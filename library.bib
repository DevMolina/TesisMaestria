abstract  ="Narrow band red emitting phosphors have a great potential to boost the luminous efficacy of warm-white LEDs if their emission spectrum peaks between 610–630 nm and re-absorption of light emitted by the green to yellow LED phosphor{,} e.g. LuAG:Ce or YAG:Ce{,} is limited. Therefore{,} Mn4+ doped fluoride type materials dominate the chase for such novel phosphors. However{,} Eu3+ activated materials are of interest too{,} but their application is hampered by the very low absorption cross section in the near UV and particularly in the blue spectral range. Therefore{,} this work deals with the sensitisation of Eu3+ photoluminescence by uranyl cations in K4(UO2)Eu2(Ge2O7)2. It turned out that this approach yields a phosphor with a luminous efficacy of 260 lm Wopt−1 with a CIE1931 colour point of x = 0.647 and y = 0.349. For the first time a phosphor converted 2700 K (In{,}Ga)N LED comprising a Eu3+ activated phosphor as the red emitter has been reported. K4(UO2)Eu2(Ge2O7)2 enables a CRI of at least 85 with an impressive luminous efficacy of around 360 lm Wopt−1."}

Therefore, much effort has been devoted to the design and development of novel LED phosphors. In this chapter, first, we briefly present the requirements for phosphors applied in wLEDs, including principle on the fabrication of wLEDs and key parameters for LEDs phosphors. Second, we describe four types of typical commercial phosphors for wLEDs, including YAG:Ce phosphors, (oxy)nitride phosphors, silicates phosphors, and Mn4+-activated fluoride phosphors. Third, we propose the design and discovery of new LEDs phosphors from two different perspectives, i.e., structural design in different host systems and codoped activators via energy transfer. Finally, we discuss the topics of structure–property relationships, which are important for future development of the phosphors for wLEDs.}

  abstract = {Currently, white light-emitting-diodes converted using Ce3+:Y3Al5O12 phosphor suffer from the shortage of red component and the easy aging of the organic silicone binder. Herein, a novel and non-rare-earth doped Mn4+:Y3Al5O12 red phosphor was synthesized by a traditional solid-state reaction. This phosphor can emit red luminescence attributed to Mn4+:2E → 4A2 spin-forbidden transition in the 600-700 nm spectral region and can be efficiently excited by both the commercially available near-ultraviolet and blue chips. Impressively, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ge4+ dopants were found to be beneficial for enhancing Mn4+ luminescence, and the related mechanisms were systematically discussed. Furthermore, Mn4+:Y3Al5O12 embedded inorganic glass ceramic was successfully fabricated to replace the phosphor in organic silicone as the color converter, and a stacking geometric configuration by sequentially coupling a Ce3+:Y3Al5O12 glass ceramic and a Mn4+:Y3Al5O12 glass ceramic with an InGaN blue chip was designed to explore its possible application in warm white light-emitting diodes.},

Following five samples i.e. YIG (Y3Fe5O12), Gd doped YIG (Y2.8Gd0.2Fe5O12), Pr doped YIG (Y2.8Pr0.2Fe5O12), Ho doped YIG (Y2.8Ho0.2Fe5O12) and Yb doped YIG (Y2.8Yb0.2Fe5O12) were prepared using sol-gel auto-combustion synthesis route. The samples were characterized via XRD, FTIR, SEM and VSM whereas VNA was also used to evaluate these samples for high frequency applications. XRD analysis confirms the peaks of garnet ferrites which show cubic phase structure for all YIG doped samples. The lattice constant in all the substituted garnet nanoferrites initially increased and then consequently decreased as the doping increased except for Pr-substituted YIG nanoferrites. This is due to the greater ionic radii of Pr as compared to other doped YIG nanoferrites. FTIR was used to find out the garnet phase in all the substituted YIG nanoferrites. The morphological features of the garnet nanoferrites were observed using the SEM images. High frequency measurements such as permittivity, permeability, dielectric losses, ac conductivity, electric modulus and Q factor of YIG and doped YIG nanoferrites were measured using VNA. Saturation magnetization, remanence, coercivity, squareness ratio, Bohr magneton and magneto crystalline anisotropy were measured from the magnetic hysteresis loops recorded by VSM. Pr-doped YIG show better dielectric and magnetic properties with lower losses at higher frequency suggest the use of these garnet nanoferrites for microwave high frequency devices and applications.},

Based on our recent experimental results, to prove the thermal ionization process, the principle and the most important features of the photocurrent excitation (PCE) and thermoluminescence excitation (TLE) spectra measurements are summarized.

The results confirmed that a pure LuAG phase can form at around 920 °C by directly crystallizing from amorphous material. Particle size of the LuAG phosphor can be controlled by adjusting the heat treatment process; therefore, both nano and micron-scale products can be obtained and they are suitable for the fabrication of laser scintillators and white light emitting diodes, respectively. Agglomeration can be observed in the nano-sized phosphor. For the micron-sized LuAG, a two-step process was used to avoid hard agglomeration. Particles of the obtained micron-sized phosphor are uniform and well-dispersed. Luminescence properties of the phosphors were characterized. Relative intensity of the micron-sized product is comparable with commercial phosphor. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

A new interpretation from the viewpoint of compression deformation of electron cloud in a rigid structure by combining orbital hybridization with solid-state energy band theory together is put forward to illustrate the intrinsic mechanisms that cause the emission spectral shift, thermal quenching, and luminescence intensity decrease of YAG: Ce upon substitution of Y3+ by Gd3+, which are out of the explanation of the classic configuration coordinate model. The results indicate that in a rigid structure, the charge deformation provides an efficient way to tune chromaticity, but the band gaps and crystal defects must be controlled by comprehensively accounting for luminescence thermal stability and efficiency.},

The absolute luminescence quantum efficiency (QE) and the activation energy ($\Delta$E) were reported. Under the excitation of near-UV light, Ce3+-doped NaBaBO3 presents a green-emission band centred at 505 nm from the allowed inter-configurational 4f-5d transition.

The thermal stability of the green luminescence was evaluated by the luminescence decays as a function of temperature. The phosphor shows an excellent thermal stability on temperature quenching effects. Compared with the reported Ce3+-doped alkali metal and alkaline earth orthoborates with the general formula MNBO3 with only blue luminescence, the peculiarity of NaBaBO3:Ce3+ is the green emission and a high doping concentration in the lattices.

We find, however, strong excited-state absorption in this material at the wavelengths of its fluorescence and we report on this excited-state absorption (ESA) here.

  abstract        = {Highly efficient phosphors with thermal stability and color-tunable emission are required for the fabrication of phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs). Currently developed engineering strategies are generally successful in photoluminescence tuning but, unfortunately, suffer severe deterioration in emission intensity/efficiency and/or thermal stability. Herein, an efficient aliovalent substitution strategy toward reinforced structural rigidity is proposed and demonstrated experimentally. By incorporating Be2+ ion into the garnet-type Lu2SrAl4SiO12:Ce3+ phosphor, the phosphor shows enhanced internal/external quantum efficiency, from 79.2{\%}/26.7{\%} to 84.5{\%}/32.9{\%}, photoluminescence tuning from green (peaking at ∼512 nm) to yellow (peaking at ∼552 nm), and zero thermal quenching, even up to 200 °C. The Be2+ substitution at the Al2/Si2 site enables stable and rigid local surroundings around the Ce3+ activator, which is responsible for the unprecedented performance. In addition, high-quality warm WLED devices with a luminous efficiency of 158.1 lm W-1, correlated color temperature of 3858 K and high color rendering index of 81.7, are obtained by combining Lu2SrAl4SiO12:Ce3+,Be2+ as the yellow emitter, CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ as the red emitter and a blue-emitting InGaN chip. These findings highlight a new strategy for performance optimization of LED phosphors by selecting rigid covalent compounds with further reinforced structural rigidity via aliovalent substitution.},

  abstract        = {Green-emitting phosphor Eu2+ doped NaBaScSi2O 7 was synthesized by a solid-state reaction, and the photoluminescence properties were investigated in conjunction with a structural analysis. The crystallographic occupancy of Eu2+ in the Sc silicate NaBaScSi2O7 matrix was studied based on the Rietveld refinements results and the crystal chemistry rules. The optimum concentration of Eu2+ in the NaBaScSi2O7 phosphor was about 10 mol{\%}, and the concentration quenching mechanism was verified to be the dipole-dipole interaction. Upon excitation at 365 nm, the composition-optimized NaBaScSi2O7:Eu2+ exhibited strong green light peaking at 501 nm with the CIE chromaticity (0.0706, 0.5540) and a high internal quantum efficiency of about 65{\%}. The thermally stable luminescence properties were also studied and compared with those of the commercial green phosphors. A white light emitting diode (w-LED) lamp was finally fabricated by using the present green phosphor and the commercial blue and red phosphors, which exhibited a high color rendering index (Ra) of 86.5 at a correlated color temperature of 2528 K with CIE coordinates of x = 0.353, y = 0.324. These results suggest that NaBaScSi2O7:Eu2+ is a potential green phosphor candidate for near-UV-pumped w-LEDs. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.},

  abstract        = {The oxide garnet Y3Al5O12 (YAG), when substituted with a few percent of the activator ion Ce3+ to replace Y3+, is a luminescent material that is nearly ideal for phosphor-converted solid-state white lighting. The local environments of the small number of substituted Ce3+ ions are known to critically influence the optical properties of the phosphor. Using a combination of powerful experimental methods, the nature of these local environments is determined and is correlated with the macroscopic luminescent properties of Ce-substituted YAG. The rigidity of the garnet structure is established and is shown to play a key role in the high quantum yield and in the resistance toward thermal quenching of luminescence. Local structural probes reveal compression of the Ce3+ local environments by the rigid YAG structure, which gives rise to the unusually large crystal-field splitting, and hence yellow emission. Effective design rules for finding new phosphor materials inferred from the results establish that efficient phosphors require rigid, highly three-dimensionally connected host structures with simple compositions that manifest a low number of phonon modes, and low activator ion concentrations to avoid quenching. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The formation of monophasic YSAON is confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. The crystal structure of YSAON is solved by XRD refinement data. DFT calculations indicate that Y4SiAlO8N has an indirect band gap of 3.819 eV. Based on the analysis of crystal structure and lifetime curves, four emission sites of YSAON:0.02Ce3+ are identified, which are Y1 (413 nm, 448 nm), Y2 (428 nm, 469 nm), Y3 (619 nm, 698 nm) and Y4 (512 nm, 569 nm), respectively. The concentration quenching of Ce3+ in YSAON is investigated in detail and it is confirmed to be due to dipole-dipole interactions. Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) spectral measurements showed that the Ce3+ and Sm3+ co-doped phosphor could be efficiently excited by near-UV light, and exhibited four emission bands peaked at 485 nm, 565 nm, 605 nm and 650 nm, respectively. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of the obtained white light can be tuned by adjusting the content of Ce3+ and Sm3+ ions. Therefore, we anticipate that these materials can be used in near-UV chip pumped white LEDs.},

The crystal structure and thermally stable luminescence of chloroborate phosphors Ba 2Ln(BO3)2Cl:Eu2+ (Ln = Y, Gd, and Lu) have been reported in this paper. X-ray diffraction studies verify the successful isomorphic substitution for Ln3+ sites in Ba 2Ln(BO3)2Cl by other smaller trivalent rare earth ions, such as Sm, Eu, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Yb. The detailed structure information for Ba2Ln(BO3)2Cl (Ln = Y, Gd, and Lu) by Rietveld analysis reveals that they all crystallize in a monoclinic P21/m space group. These compounds display interesting and tunable photoluminescence (PL) properties after Eu2+-doping. Ba 2Ln(BO3)2Cl:Eu2+ phosphors exhibit bluish-green/greenish-yellow light with peak wavelengths at 526, 548, and 511 nm under 365 UV light excitation for Ba2Y(BO3) 2Cl:Eu2+, Ba2Gd(BO3) 2Cl:Eu2+, and Ba2Lu(BO3) 2Cl:Eu2+, respectively. Furthermore, they possess a high thermal quenching temperature. With the increase of temperature, the emission bands show blue shifts with broadening bandwidths and slightly decreasing emission intensities.

Fe contributes greatly to VNIR spectral signatures, producing features near 1 and 2 µm for Fe2+ in spectra of pyroxene and glass, while a broad, strong band from {\~{}}0.9 to 1.3 µm is characteristic of Fe2+ in olivine, carbonate, and many sulfates; a weak band near 1.2 µm is due to Fe2+ in feldspar; and bands near 0.6 and 0.9 µm arise from Fe3+ in ferric oxides/hydroxides. Water bands occur near 0.96, 1.15, 1.4, 1.9, and 2.9 µm, depending on the mineral structure, while structural OH bands occur near 1.4, 2.1–2.5, and 2.7 µm. Additional features are observed for carbonates, nitrates, sulfates, phosphates, chlorides, and perchlorates. The spectral signatures of geologic samples are also affected by how photons interact with particles in the sample. Factors such as grain size, coatings and mixtures influence the reflectance, transmittance, and absorption of photons at grain boundaries and contribute to the VNIR spectral properties of geologic materials.},

Characterization of samples was carried out by XRD, Rieltveld refinement, SEM and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that the substitution favors system stability and formation of garnets single phase with cubic structure and space group of Ia3d (230) at temperatures lower than reported by other authors.

The effects of pH and annealing temperature on the structure, phase formation, magnetic properties and crystallite size were investigated. A cubic YIG phase was obtained for the sample annealed at 1400 °C. The presented results showed that the pH value of the starting solution affects the crystal size and consequently, the saturation magnetization.},

Among these are an unconventional magnetic hysteresis loop with an intermediate saturation state observed in garnet trilayers, and an ultrasensitive magnetic switching behaviour in garnet-oxide composites (GOC). We also report on the unusually high thermal exposure stability observed in some nanoengineered metal-dielectric multilayers.

  abstract  = {Currently, phosphor-in-glass (PiG) approach draws great attention because of its excellent thermal resistance and facile process in WLED fabrication. However, the red light deficiency results in high correlated color temperature (CCT) and low color rendering index (CRI) in white light-emitting diode (WLED). Herein, a new LuAG:Ce3+ phosphor-in-glass (Lu-PiG) combining with the CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ red phosphor layer was synthesized by the low temperature co-sintering and screen-printing techniques, which was experimentally demonstrated to replace the conventional polymer-based phosphor converter and realized the chromaticity tuning for LuAG:Ce3+ phosphor with WLED. The Lu-PiG constructed WLED exhibited excellent thermal stability, but it still showed a typical cold white light resulting from the absence of red light component. Therefore, a stacking geometric configuration by screen-printing a red phosphor layer on the Lu-PiG substrate (R{\&}Lu-PiG) was designed to solve red deficiency problem. The R{\&}Lu-PiG color converter showed an excellent thermal stability with only 8.2{\%} emission loss compared to the Lu-PiG when elevating temperature from 303 K to 433 K. By adjusting the CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphor content in the layer, we obtained a high-performance warm WLED with a luminous efficacy of 102.1 lm/W, a CCT of 3410 K and a CRI of 76.5 under 20 mA current driving. Thus, it is expected that this developed R{\&}Lu-PiG color converters could have large potential applications in high-power warm WLED.},

Carbon used as the susceptor additionally creates a reducing atmosphere around the sample that helps stabilize the desired luminescent compound. High quality, phase-pure materials are prepared within a fraction of the time and using a fraction of the energy required in a conventional ceramic preparation; the microwave technique allows for a reduction of about 95{\%} in preparation time, making it possible to obtain phase pure, Ce 3+-substituted garnet compounds in under 20 min of reaction time. It is estimated that the overall reduction in energy compared with ceramic routes as practised in the lab is close to 99{\%}. Conventionally prepared material is compared with material prepared using microwave heating in terms of structure, morphology, and optical properties, including quantum yield and thermal quenching of luminescence. Finally, the microwave-prepared compounds have been incorporated into light-emitting diode "caps" to test their performance characteristics in a real device, in terms of their photon efficiency and color coordinates. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The 5S2 fluorescence decays were recorded as a function of temperature and Ho3+ concentration in order to investigate the process of quenching of fluorescence due to cross relaxation among two ions. Conversion of red and infrared laser radiation to green 5S2 and blue 5F3 emission is reported. Under pulsed resonant excitation of the 5F5 or 5I5 levels the upconversion was found to be due to energy transfer process between two excited ions.

Internal Sm-Nd isochrons give ages of 24-42 Ma. These dates are older than the eruption age for the host picrite tuff (∼16 Ma) indicating that garnet and clinopyroxene may not have been in isotopic equilibrium in the mantle (at 19-23 kbar, 990-1070 °C). In spite of their fertile major element chemistry, many peridotites have extremely depleted Nd and Sr isotope compositions (calculated from mineral analyses: $\epsilon$NdT=+14 to +27; 87Sr/86Sr=0.7017-0.7028) and therefore plot outside the MORB field in the Sr-Nd isotope diagram. Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr model ages for unmetasomatised peridotites are concordant for each sample within ±0.4 Ga and suggest a depletion event of a primitive mantle ∼2 Gy ago, also consistent with Re-Os data on the same xenolith suite [Pearson, D.G., Irvine, G.J., Ionov, D.A., Boyd, F.R., Dreibus, G.E., 2004.

This suggests that the mantle depletion event was roughly matched with formation of the mature continental crust in the region (∼2.0 Ga according to U-Pb and Sm-Nd dating) and implies that the mantle peridotites have been attached to the continental lithosphere since that time and survived several major tectono-thermal events. The Paleoproterozoic formation age for the fairly fertile Vitim mantle domain indicates that average lithospheric mantle compositions cannot be used to assess lithospheric formation ages in continental off-craton mantle. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Factors influencing on the intensity of luminescence and the location of emission band of YAG:Ce, such as the type of flux used in SS, the reaction atmosphere, the concentration of activator, were investigated in detail. We accomplished red or blue shift of Ce emission band by a number of techniques in order to match with the variable emission wavelength of blue light emitting diodes.

We chose to investigate experimentally the effect of temperature on a sample's properties which are important to microwave scientists and engineers, after undergoing heat treatments. In this study, yttrium iron garnet (YIG) was prepared via mechanical alloying involving a 24 h milling time of a mixture of yttrium oxide (Y2O3) and iron oxide (Fe2O3). The samples were then sintered at different temperatures at 900, 1100, 1200 and 1350 °C with 10 h holding time and optimized for microstructure. The microstructure, magnetic and physical properties were studied in order to understand the resulting materials. Starting powders were successfully prepared using high energy ball milling technique for 24 h. The XRD patterns confirmed the formation of the single-phase cubic garnet structure with no extra lines corresponding to any other crystallographic phase or unreacted ingredient. A complete phase of YIG was observed to form at 900 °C sintering temperature due to the high reactivity of the nanosized starting powder. SEM micrographs showed larger grain size as the sintering temperature increased, consequently increasing the number of multi-domain grains. The permeability values were influenced by several factors which are degree of crystallinity, dominant magnetization process (ease of domain walls movement in multi-domain grains or spin rotation in single-domain grains) and large enough grain size which exceed the critical grain size for transition from single-domain to multi-domain grains. As for magnetic properties, the Hc values were found to increase as the sintering temperature increased from 900 to 1200 °C and subsequently reduced at 1350 °C sintering temperature. The increased value of coercivity for lower sintering was due to shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy for small enough grains. An integrated analysis of phase, microstructural and hysteresis data pointed to existence of three distinct shape-differentiated groups of B–H hysteresis loops which belong to samples with moderate and strong magnetism.},

The regions for garnet phase formation are initially described with respect to larger rare earth substitution and show reasonable correlation to previous crystal chemistry studies for the garnet parent structure. While the pure silicate phosphor also has apatite second phases, a significant amount of Ce 3+ enters the garnet phase, giving Ce 3+ luminescence that is significantly redder when compared to typical Al 3+ garnet phosphors with quantum efficiencies comparable to commercial Ce 3+ garnet phosphors. Potential reasons for the emission red shift and the high quantum efficiency are discussed. Finally, the performance of these new phosphors is tested within LED based lamps.

The structure and luminescence properties of these ceramics have been discussed in detail. Polished transparent ceramics with uniform grains exhibited the highest optical transmittance of 81.9{\%} at 800 nm. After the introduction of Mn2+ into the ceramic, the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the Lu2.885Ce0.015Mn0.1Al4.9Si0.1O12 ceramic showed a green emission band centered at 520 nm and a red emission band centered at 582 nm under the 450 nm excitation. These ceramics exhibited excellent luminescence thermal stability, and the quenching temperature of all the ceramics exceeded 200 °C. The fluorescence lifetime indicated an efficient energy transfer from Ce3+ to Mn2+, and the highest energy transfer efficiency reached 42.3{\%}. According to the PL spectra and emission decay curves, the energy transferred from Ce3+ to Mn2+ via a non-radiative transition. Via controlling the concentration of the Mn2+-Si4+ ions, the emitted light changed from green to orange and the chromaticity color coordinates shifted from (0.3758, 0.5722) to (0.4594, 0.5093).

  abstract = {All-inorganic color converters are promising luminescent materials for high-power white lighting due to their excellent heat resistance and high thermal conductivity. However, the low color rendering of converters limits their applications in high-quality lighting. Herein, a broad-band and stable phosphor-in-glass (PiG) was developed for high-power white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). This PiG converter was fabricated by sintering a green/red phosphor glass film on a glass plate with a patterned metal layer. The green Y3Al3.08Ga1.92O12:Ce3+ phosphor has a broad emission, which compensates for the cyan cavity between blue and green emission spectra, and then produces full-spectrum white light combined with the red CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphor. The all-inorganic WLEDs were realized by welding the PiG on a substrate. The optical performance of PiG-based WLEDs was optimized by varying the film thickness. At the film thickness of 150 $\mu$m, the fabricated WLEDs achieve ultrahigh color quality of color rendering index (CRI) values (Ra = 95.4, R9 = 95.1, and R13 = 97.3) and fidelity/gamut index values (Rf = 91 and Rg = 102). The corresponding luminous efficacy (LE) and correlated color temperature (CCT) are 65 lm/W and 5260 K, respectively. After aging at 100 °C for 200 h, the PiG-based WLEDs exhibit low efficiency loss and stable color quality compared with the traditional phosphor-in-silicone (PiS)-based WLEDs. The prepared PiG is a broad-band and stable converter enabling ultrahigh color rendering for high-power white lighting.},

  abstract  = {Materials exhibiting low-field magneto-electric and magneto-dielectric (MD) response at room temperature are essential for utilization in multifunctional devices. Magneto-dielectric properties of Lu3Fe5O12 substituted with a magnetic ion (Terbium) at its dodecahedral (non-magnetic) site are investigated. The measured dielectric permittivity at various magnetic fields exhibits a giant MD effect ({\~{}}65{\%}) at remarkably low fields (H{\~{}}1 kOe) at room temperature. The MD response of Lu3Fe5O12 is enhanced due to the coupling effect of substituted magnetic Terbium ions in the non-magnetic Lu-site interacting with the neighboring Fe-sites. Studies suggest a route towards future applications of the MD effect in advanced devices.},

  abstract  = {Polycrystalline Lu3Fe5O12, prepared using the solid state reaction method, has Fe in the mixed valence state as inferred from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A spectral change in the impedance plot at 343 K is attributed to metal-like to insulator transition (MIT), which is analyzed in terms of localized and delocalized eg electrons. The change in the slope at 343 K in the DC conductivity plot also proves the MIT. The dependence of Z′ on temperature and Z″ on frequency clearly substantiates the presence of localized electrons up to 343 K and delocalized electrons above 343 K. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Currently, the development of excellent red phosphor materials has attracted much attention in daily lighting, backlit displays, optical thermometry sensors and plant growth fields. However, spectral peak position modulation and bandwidth are still crucial challenges. Herein, we design Eu3+→Mn4+ energy transfer in the Lu3Al5O12 (LuAG) garnet host. On the one hand, photoluminescence tuning from narrow orangish-red emission (593 nm) to narrow deep-red light (668 nm) is successfully obtained, and the energy transfer efficiency reaches 47{\%}. On the other hand, LuAG:Eu3+ exhibits anti-thermal-quenching properties; that is, the peak intensity reaches 166{\%} at 200 °C of the initial intensity at 25 °C. By designing Eu3+→Mn4+ energy transfer, Mn4+ thermal quenching performance is dramatically improved. The photoluminescence peak intensities at 668 nm for LuAG:0.01Mn4+ and LuAG:0.05Eu3+,0.01Mn4+ retain 3.26{\%} and 26{\%} at 200 °C of the original intensity at 25 °C. The corresponding energy transfer mechanism to improve thermal quenching is revealed. According to the fluorescence intensity ratio technique, the maximum values of Sa and Sr for LuAG:0.05Eu3+,0.01Mn4+ are 0.07 K-1 and 0.7{\%} K-1 at 303 K. The temperature sensitivity calculation indicates that LuAG:Eu3+,Mn4+ phosphors can act as promising candidates in optical thermometry sensors. This work provides an insight to achieve narrow red emission modulation and thermal quenching improvement.},

  abstract = {Ce3+ activated Lu3Al5O12 (LuAG) phosphor-in-glass (PiG) based on tellurite glass with low melting temperature has been synthesized and the LuAG particles are proved to be well-distributed in tellurite glass with the particle size of {\~{}}5 $\mu$m. The introduction of H3BO3 as a flux is helpful to promote polycrystalline growth and reduce reaction temperature of LuAG:Ce3+ green phosphor, but accompanied by the generation of LuBO3 impurity phase. Differential fluorescence emission behaviors between LuAG:Ce3+ and LuAG-PiG illustrate that the luminous ability of the LuBO3:Ce3+ is strongly restrained while intense pure green light is released in composite. LuAG-PiG combines the admirable formability of tellurite glass with the favorable luminescent capability of LuAG:Ce3+, in which LuBO3 can be effectively eliminated to achieve LuAG:Ce3+ depuration. Prominent depuration capacity and intense fluorescence emission demonstrate that LuAG-PiG is a potential candidate in developing high-power light emitting diodes lighting.},
